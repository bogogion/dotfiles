# ***LATE NIGHT***
Finished 6/3/22
## Description
LATE NIGHT is my first semi-serious rice. It's a primarily black + purple colorscheme. The background, style, and colorscheme just really feels like a late-night vibe. 

## Programs used
- dwm
- st
- slstatus
- dmenu (unchanged)  

## Resources source
- Wallpaper from wallpaperflare
- Colorscheme is "Lavandula" found on [Gogh](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/)
- [Hack font](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack)

## Notes
- The fonts are larger than normal as I find it looks better, just change the number of pixels in the dwm & st configs.
